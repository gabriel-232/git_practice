						<h3>Description of Coding</h3>
					<p>Coding theory is the study of the properties of codes and their respective fitness for specific applications. Codes are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection and correction, data transmission and data storage. Codes are studied by various scientific disciplines—such as information theory, electrical engineering, mathematics, linguistics, and computer science—for the purpose of designing efficient and reliable data transmission methods. This typically involves the removal of redundancy and the correction or detection of errors in the transmitted data.

There are four types of coding. Namely
<ol>
    <li>Data compression (or, source coding)</li>
    <li>Error control (or channel coding)</li>
    <li>Cryptographic coding</li>
    <li>Line coding</li>
</ol>

							<h3>Mastercodeweb</h3>
							<p>Mastercodeweb is an academy purposely created by the Owusu family to build a world of people with coding ideas. Since generations come and go, things of the past gradually become outmoded which make it dificult for does who still learn such old knowledges and skills to have a standard living of life.Our mission is to provide good and updated knowledges to the the people to help develop the country ghana</p>
